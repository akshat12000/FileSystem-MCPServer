This project is a beginner-friendly MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for file system exploration. It demonstrates core MCP concepts through practical tools that interact with the file system.

## Project Type: MCP Server (TypeScript/Node.js)

## Key Components:
- **Server Implementation**: Core MCP server using @modelcontextprotocol/sdk-server
- **File System Tools**: Tools for directory listing, file reading, file info, and file search
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed development for better code quality
- **Configuration**: Proper MCP server configuration and build setup

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand MCP server architecture
- Learn how to create MCP tools
- Practice TypeScript development
- Explore file system operations in Node.js

## Development Guidelines:
- Follow MCP server patterns and conventions
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Provide clear documentation and examples
- Keep tools simple but functional for learning
